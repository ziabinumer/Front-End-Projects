                Python is an interpreted, high-level programming language known for its elegant syntax
                and dynamic semantics. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python 
                has since evolved into a powerful tool used in various domains, including web development, 
                data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.

                Before diving into Python programming, you'll need to set up your development environment. 
                Fortunately, Python's ease of installation makes this process straightforward. 
                Follow the installation guides provided for your operating system to install Python 
                and get ready to start coding.

                Once Python is installed, you can launch the Python interpreter 
                and begin writing and executing Python code. If you're new to 
                programming, don't worry - Python's interactive mode allows you
                to experiment with code and see immediate results, 
                making the learning process intuitive and engaging.

                Comments are essential for documenting your code and 
                making it more understandable for yourself and others. 
                In Python, comments can be single-line or multi-line and 
                are preceded by the <strong>#</strong> symbol.

            <!-- Content for Variables in Python -->
            <p>
                Variables are used to store data values that can be referenced 
                and manipulated in a program. In Python, variables are dynamically typed, 
                meaning you don't need to declare their type explicitly. Python variables can 
                store various types of data, 
                including numbers, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and more.
            </p>

                # Assigning values to variables <br>

                age = 30 <br>
                height = 5.6 <br>

            <!-- Content for Data Types -->
            <p>
                Python supports a wide range of data types, including primitive types 
                like integers, floats, booleans, and strings, as well as complex types 
                like lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and more. 
                Understanding Python's data types is crucial for 
                writing efficient and robust code.
